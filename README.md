# Multiplication Training
This is a simple multiplication training program.  
I wrote this mostly to learn the basics of Rust.

## Features
- Randomly generated multiplication problems
- Raw mode for better user experience
- Colorful output :sunglasses:

## Next steps
Basically adding stats. Here are some ideas:
- Keep track of the number of correct and wrong answers.
- Keep track of the time it took to answer a question.
- Keep track of the average time it took to answer a question.
